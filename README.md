> libzetta-rs is a stable interface for programmatic administration of ZFS

## Installation
Not yet. It won't destroy your pool, but API might change any moment. Wait until 1.0.0. I have a pretty decent roadmap to 1.0.0.

## Usage
Public API for `zpool` interface is almost at the point where I'm going to stabilize it, but until I start work on `zfs` portion I don't want to call it stable.

### FreeBSD
This library mostly focused on FreeBSD support. This should work on any FreeBSD version since 9.2.
However, I have no intention on supporting legacy versions. Supported versions:
 - 11.3
 - 12.0

### Linux
Right now it definitely works with `0.7.13` and entire `0.7.x` branch. However, only latest version used for tests.

## How it works
ZFS doesn't have stable API at all. There is `libzfs_core` which supposed to be it, but it really isn't. While `libzfs_core` is somewhat stable `libnvpair` used in it isn't and `libnv` isn't available on Linux. I might embed portable `libnv`. Now the tricky part — `libzfs_core` is just for zfs, there is not `libzpool_core` which means you either have to rely on unstable (in terms of API) `libzpool` or use `zpool(8)`. I decided to use `zpool(8)` because that's a recommended way of doing it.

## Running tests

Note that integration tests do a lot of zpool and zfs operations on live system. I recommend spin up a VM and use `run_tests.sh` to run integration tests in side that VM. Tests also take a lot of disk space because each vdev is at least 64mb file.

## Current feature status

### zpool

|       | Create | Destroy | Get Properties | Set Properties | Scrub | Export | Import | List Available | Read Status | Add vdev | Replace Disk |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|-------|--------|--------|----------------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| open3 |    ✔   |    ✔    |        ✔       |        ✔       |   ✔   |    ✔   |    ✔   |     ✔    |      ✔ ¹     |     ✔    |       ❌      |

1. Reads the status, but api isn't stable and does poor job at reporting scrubbing status.


### zfs

Literally nothing works.

## Alternatives

### https://github.com/whamcloud/rust-libzfs

Unlike them LibZetta doesn't link against private libraries no one supposed to link against. I also have docs and more sugar.

### https://github.com/jmesmon/rust-libzfs

LibZetta has zpool APIs. LibZetta shares `-sys` crates with this library. LibZetta also will delegate certain features of `zfs(8)` to open3 implementation.
