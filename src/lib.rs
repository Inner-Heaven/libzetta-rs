//! Rust bindings to libzfs_core and wrapper around `zpool(8)`.
//!
//! This library intends to provide a safe, low-level interface to ZFS operator tools. As such, not
//! much will be sugar coated here.
//!
//! # Overview
//! ## zpool
//! A feature complete wrapper around `zpool(8)` with a somewhat stable API. I can't
//! guarantee that the API won't change at any moment, but I don't see a reason for it change at the
//! moment.
//!
//! Refer to the [zpool module documentation](zpool/index.html) for more information.
//!
//! ## zfs
//! Most of functionality of `libzfs_core` is covered with some gaps filled in by `open3`.
//!
//! Refer to the [zfs module documentation](zfs/index.html) for more information.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! This section is currently under contstruction. Meanwhile, look at integration tests for
//! inspiration.
//!
//! # Project Structure
//! ### parsers
//! Module for PEG parsers backed by [Pest](https://pest.rs/).
//!
//! ### zpool
//! This module contains everything you need to work with zpools.
